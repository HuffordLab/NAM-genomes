### NAM genome paper related scripts and workflows

Please follow this structure for your contribution.

1. Add all the scripts for one specific task inside aptly named folder (eg: agp-generation), use hyphen for gaps and use all lower-case letters.

2. Add a README.md file within the folder, specifically addressing the order and inputs required for the scripts you put in the folder

3. If you have any figures, please create a folder within that section folder  (please name it "assets") and drop them there. You can also add other files or things that doesn't qualify as scripts in there.

4. Please let me know if you have any questions or have any suggestions!

Go, NAMsters!
